/* For this project, I used a combination of MVVM & DCI Architecture
 * The goal of the project was to make an app that uses the Yoda Speak API
 * to take text input and output what the API replies. 
 * This app does that. In order to add different api 'translation' clients, 
 * The coder would only have to write an API Client for that service (see YodaAPIClient),
 * ( can take advantage of the Networking client that wraps AFNetworking )
 * a TextManipulator (see YodaSaysContext) & TextManipulatorViewModel (see YodaSaysViewModel)
 * These files are all together are under 100 lines of code. 
 * 
 * TextManipulationViewController can be initialized with any instance of TextMainuplator
 * and it will take care of the input output styling.
 *
